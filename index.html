The Great Gatsby Essay
	Frances Scott Key Fitzgerald was an American writer during the 1920s, most known for his novel The Great Gatsby. The Great Gatsby takes place during the roaring twenties, when wealth and decadence were of the utmost importance, and social class was hinged upon one’s possessions. Examining texts through a lens is helpful to try and  understand what the author is attempting to convey to their audience, along with their reasons for doing so. The biographical lens focuses on the experiences of the author, and how that relates to their writing. When looking through the biographical lens, it’s apparent that Fitzgerald uses the relationships seen in The Great Gatsby to project his own experience of love to reveal the illusion of grandeur that love can be when its roots derive from unrealistic desires. 
Fitzgerald creates the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy through conveying his own experiences of relationships, with their blossoming beginnings and struggle with insincere, materialistic and societally focused desires. Firstly, when examining Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship, which began in Louisville, during October of 1917, it’s apparent that both Gatsby and Daisy are consumed by love for each other. Jordan Baker explains to Nick, “They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away”(Fitzgerald 74). Jordan even goes on to explain that,”The officer [Gatsby] looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at”(75). The sparks of any new relationship can cause this infatuation, but Fitzgerald’s description illustrates that this is no ordinary attraction to another.  Gatsby’s adoration of Daisy is reflective of what many people experience early on in their relationships, as their attraction and love for each other only grows, something Fitzgerald had seen in his life with Zelda. Furthermore, when looking at Fitzgerald’s life, the reader can observe obvious parallels between Gatsby and Fitzgerald, most notably, their experiences with war and love, for example when F. Scott “was stationed near Montgomery, Alabama, he met Zelda Sayre, the daughter of an Alabama Supreme Court judge. They fell deeply in love”(Mizener). Fitzgerald’s relationship with Zelda is comparable to Gatsby’s relationship with Daisy and one can take away the theme of the female being born into a higher class. Fitzgerald often describes his personal struggle and resentment of classism, and these two relationships are the embodiment of this struggle. Moreover, when studying Daisy more, the reader notices that not only is she driven by materialistic desires, she is almost controlled by them and all her actions are governed by an overarching need for financial abundance. This sad, yet pragmatic situation is demonstrated many times throughout The Great Gatsby. Shortly after Gatsby leaves for war, “she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before,”(Fitzgerald 75) illustrating how love can mean so little when one is challenged by their inner desire of having more. While Jordan had said that Daisy was distraught when Gatsby had to leave for the war, and that she wanted to go to New York to see him off, one would think it would take more time for her to move on, yet she does and with great opulence. Another example of Daisy’s materialistically oriented nature is when Gatsby shows her his house, and she is emotional about his collection of fine English shirts, “They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in thick folds. ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such‒such beautiful shirts before.”(Fitzgerald 92) There is no doubt that Daisy had seen finer shirts, as her husband Tom was as rich if not richer than Gatsby, and had no problem gallivanting his possessions. She really means that she hadn’t seen Gatsby with such fine objects, and her emotional discharge is her realization that she could have had both her materialistic desire met and her love had she waited for Gatsby in the first place. Fitzgerald must empathize with Gatsby’s side of this for example, if one looks at his relationship with Zelda, they would be able to see the earthly-mindedness within his own experience with love. When Fitzgerald was discharged in 1919, Zelda Sayre was “unwilling to wait while Fitzgerald succeeded in the advertisement business,”(“A Brief Life of Fitzgerald”) illustrating only a small portion of his struggle with object-oriented mindsets of his era. Zelda was also,”unwilling to live on his small salary,” drawing stark comparisons to Daisy’s relations to Gatsby. The similarities between Gatsby’s experience with love to Fitzgerald’s own are uncanny, and the reader can infer that Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby as a warning to people focused on the tangibles of life, trying to convince them that love derives from authenticity, not the greed for more. Fitzgerald also writes the marriage that Tom and Daisy have reflective of his own marriage with Zelda Sayre.
Through projecting his past experiences, Fitzgerald writes the relationship Tom and Daisy have as a reflection of his own conflict-stricken and unfaithful relationship with Zelda, attempting to dissuade people from the consequences of debauchery. Early on in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald reveals the strained relationship that Tom and Daisy have because of Tom’s unfaithful nature. Jordan Baker tells Nick, “Tom’s got some woman in New York,”(Fitzgerald 15) revealing to the reader a theme of disloyalty that carries on throughout the novel. Fitzgerald writes this theme not only because it adds to the plot as a whole, but it is the unfortunate theme of much of his life. During their time in France, the Fitzgeralds relationship went through a turbulent period, as when Fitzgerald was writing The Great Gatsby, “their marriage was damaged by Zelda’s involvement with a French aviator.”(“A Brief Life of Fitzgerald”) Zelda’s affair must have had some sway in the writing of his famous novel, as it would be difficult for it not to. With a plot so centered upon infidelity and the materialistic nature of people, both problems Fitzgerald faced in his life, it’s clear that he wrote The Great Gatsby with his affliction from these issues in mind. Later in the novel, when Daisy, Tom, Gatsby, Nick, and Jordan Baker go to lunch at the Plaza Hotel, tensions come to a boiling point, and Daisy admits,”I am though,”(Fitzgerald 133) when the matter of her leaving Tom for Gatsby is brought up. While Daisy does not leave Tom in the end, this series of events demonstrates the ramifications affairs can have. Similarly, while Zelda and Fitzgerald do not divorce after her affair in France, their marriage and life only goes downhill from there. Zelda “suffered her first breakdown,” shortly after the affair, and she became an alcoholic, relapsing multiple times until their eventual estrangement. Zelda Sayre also ended up in and out of hospitals from 1930 until her eventual death in 1948, illustrating the consequences that unhealthy and unhappy relationships can have. While it isn’t clear-cut that the reason for their struggles was solely her affair, it obviously affected their marriage negatively, and could have been the catalyst for Zelda’s mental health issues. 
After examining his work through the biographical lens, it’s clear that Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby’s relationships with his own experiences of love to illustrate that when the foundation of love is set upon unrealistic expectations, it can often be a pipe dream. Fitzgerald wrote the relationships seen in The Great Gatsby emulating his experiences in the marriage he had with Zelda Sayre, and he illustrated both the negative and positive aspects of his relationship, along with trying to prove to the reader that love must not root from materialistic desires. In short, one must ensure that their love is built upon a foundation of authenticity and friendship, not earthly-minded desires that plague so much of modern life.
